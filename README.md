Basic VS Code support for the Monster programming language and `.mnst` source files.

This extension is developed alongside the main Monster compiler project:

- Compiler: <https://github.com/BitIntx/monster-lang>
- Extension: <https://github.com/BitIntx/monster-vscode>

## Install

From the VS Code Marketplace:

- <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monster-lang.monster-language>

Or from the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension monster-lang.monster-language
```

## What You Get

- `.mnst` file association
- syntax highlighting for current Monster syntax, including `enum`, payload enums, `match`, `sizeof`, pointers, slices, imports, and `print_ln_*`
- line comments and bracket rules
- starter snippets for `main`, `hello`, `if`, and `while`
- Monster file icon support for themes that do not define one already

## Quick Start

```mnst
fn main() -> i32 {
    print_ln_str("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

Open a `.mnst` file and VS Code will automatically switch to Monster language mode.

## Current Scope

Today this extension focuses on the basics:

- syntax coloring
- snippets
- file association
- icon support

Not included yet:

- language server features
- diagnostics from the compiler
- formatting
- hover, go-to-definition, or semantic tokens

## Local Development

Open this repository in VS Code and press `F5` to launch an Extension Development Host.

You can also copy or symlink this folder into your local VS Code extensions directory:

- Linux/macOS: `~/.vscode/extensions/monster-language`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\\monster-language`

## Packaging

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run package
```

This creates a `.vsix` file that you can install locally in VS Code or upload to the Marketplace.
